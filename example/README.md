# Relay Starter Kit

This kit includes an app server, a GraphQL server, and a transpiler that you can use to get started building an app with Relay. For a walkthrough, see the [Relay tutorial](https://facebook.github.io/relay/docs/tutorial.html).

## Installation

```
npm install
```

## Running

Start a local server:

```
meteor
```

## Developing

Any changes you make to the app will cause the app to automatically rebuild or refresh. Even if you change your GraphQL schema, you don't need to run any special scripts!
